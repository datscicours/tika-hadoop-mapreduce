Apache Tika integration with Java MapReduce for Hadoop

This project helps to get over the inefficiency of processing multiple small files in Hadoop. Moreover, it allows for processing and analysis of binary documents in Hadoop using Apache Tika by integrating it in a MapReduce job.

An article about 'Processing and Content Analysis of Various Document Types using MapReduce and IBM BigInsights' is currently published here: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ba-mapreduce-biginsights-analysis/ with full descriptions and usage of the code.
